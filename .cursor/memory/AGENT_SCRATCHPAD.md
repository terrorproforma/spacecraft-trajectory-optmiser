# Agent Scratchpad

Use this file as persistent, repo-local execution memory.

## File Policy

- Current policy: `COMMITTED`
- Rationale: GPU gate execution lessons and reproducibility guardrails must be shared across workers.

## How To Use

1. Read latest entries before starting meaningful work.
2. Build a short preflight checklist from recurring mistakes and preferences.
3. Re-read before risky operations and broad refactors.
4. Log high-signal learnings immediately during the task.
5. Append one new session entry before handoff.

## Retained Lessons

- `[user]` Work only in `/home/angus/spacecraft-trajectory-optmiser`; preserve existing uncommitted recovery work.
- `[user]` Never weaken frozen tolerances or benchmark definitions, discard negative evidence, use CPU fallback, amend/reset/force, push, or open a PR.
- `[user]` Gate G4 remains unauthorised until every G3 criterion passes.
- `[tool]` Canonical CUDA work runs through WSL Ubuntu-22.04 with CUDA 12.8 and an RTX 5090.
- `[self]` Treat missing production drivers and harnesses as implementation scope, not blockers.
- `[self]` Preserve machine-readable failures and censored benchmark points; report matched end-to-end nonlinear quality.
- `[self]` Never use backslash-sensitive Perl through PowerShell/WSL for line endings; it changed `return`/`pattern` tokens. Use PowerShell `ReadAllText().Replace("`r`n", "`n")`, then rebuild.

## Session Entries

### 2026-09-01 11:42 AEST - Complete G3

#### Task Summary

- Delivered device-only recovery, four production CUDA SCvx drivers, parity, H1, qualification,
  sealed evidence, and the passing G3 report.

#### Mistakes And Fixes

- `[self]` A backslash-sensitive line-ending command changed `return` and `pattern` tokens.
  The warnings-as-errors build detected it; repaired tokens, recorded the PowerShell-only
  normalization rule, and rebuilt all targets.
- `[tool]` Initcheck found recovery/scaling allocations unused on bounded paths. Zero-initialized
  every create-time scratch allocation and reran all four sanitizer tools.
- `[self]` The first summary parser treated racecheck wording and “0 tests failed” incorrectly.
  Preserved the original archive, fixed parser-specific positive markers, and resealed all raw
  evidence with correction provenance.

#### What Worked

- Projected KKT correction after device CGLS reduced 6-DoF stationarity below `1e-6` while
  transactional rollback kept rejected recovery bit-identical to the pre-recovery PDHG iterate.
- A schema-validated six-size H1 sweep with seven repeats and seeded bootstrap retained every point.

#### Guardrails For Next Session

- Re-read the frozen roadmap sections 9-10 and existing native contracts before broad CUDA edits.
- Verify recovery and outer-loop lifecycle under all four Compute Sanitizer tools.
- Treat each sanitizer tool's clean summary text separately; racecheck does not use `ERROR SUMMARY`.

#### Follow-Ups / Risks

- The G3 implementation is committed and G4 is authorised.
- Nsight under WSL previously omitted kernel and GPU-memory records; retain this negative result.

### 2026-09-01 17:30 AEST - Gate G4 qualification

#### Task Summary

- Froze G4 policy, pinned and executed QOCO-GPU, added per-outer forcing/fingerprint/work telemetry,
  and ran nontrivial P1-C/P1-D/P1-E qualification starts.

#### Mistakes And Fixes

- `[self]` Launched tests concurrently with the first power campaign. Preserved that contaminated
  run as negative evidence, excluded it, and reran the campaign in isolation.
- `[tool]` PowerShell expanded Bash loop variables and the login shell omitted CUDA tools from
  `PATH`. Replaced loops with explicit commands and absolute tool paths.
- `[self]` Tightened the legacy G3 production fixture to the G4 floor, causing one regression.
  Restored the G3 `1e-6` fixture while retaining the frozen G4 `1e-8` policy.

#### What Worked

- QOCO-GPU commit `09f0495` built for `sm_120` on CUDA 12.8 with cuDSS 0.7.1.6 and executed a real
  CUDA SOCP smoke solve.
- Device-side numeric fingerprints were identical across rejected under-solved re-solves, and all
  four Compute Sanitizer tools remained clean.

#### Follow-Ups / Risks

- G4 is FAIL/unresolved and G5 is not authorised.
- Nontrivial references expose that the device outer driver does not update every
  reference/trust/penalty coefficient. Fix this before restarting primary H5.
- The pinned QOCO API has primal-only warm start; H6 needs an audited dual-capable adapter or an
  explicit primal-only hybrid hypothesis revision before a future preregistration.
- WSL power sampling showed 1.86-1.94 second gaps despite a 50 ms request; energy is diagnostic.

### 2026-09-01 18:00 AEST - Displaced-reference root-cause correction

#### Task Summary

- Added fixed-pattern device updates for reference tracking, exact-penalty epigraph costs,
  trust-cone centres/radii, low-thrust radial halfspaces, and 6-DoF quaternion linearisations.
- Added CPU/device coefficient parity plus trust-radius and penalty-mutation checks.
- Corrected outer merit scaling and stale-primal evaluation after an identical-CQP re-solve.

#### Mistakes And Fixes

- `[self]` Initially reused the outer virtual merit weight as the transcription L1 coefficient.
  Separated the fixed transcription weight because these are distinct CPU contracts.
- `[self]` The first metric correction used raw fuel, state, and virtual magnitudes. Matched the
  CPU driver's thrust, trust-scale, terminal, mass, and virtual normalisations instead.
- `[prior implementation]` Re-solve telemetry came from the refined solve while acceptance still
  used the pre-refinement primal. Regathered, replayed, and reevaluated the refined primal.

#### What Worked

- All four production fixtures pass coefficient-by-coefficient CPU/device checks at `5e-12`;
  trust radius and exact-penalty mutations occur in place with no topology mutation.
- Rejected re-solves retain identical numerical fingerprints, while changing trust radii produce
  distinct fingerprints as expected.

#### Follow-Ups / Risks

- The original G4 diagnosis was incomplete: its one-outer-iteration qualification never reached
  a second reference update. After the update fix, P1-C still fails because PDHCG returns a poor
  CQP candidate and eventually exhausts the trust region.
- G3's nominal trajectory parity was materially weaker than displaced-start outer-loop parity;
  the G3 report was amended and the affected displaced-start coverage is no longer claimed.
- G4 remains FAIL and G5 remains unauthorised pending an accurate QOCO-GPU adapter or another
  production solver correction that passes frozen matched-quality criteria.
- The first nominally complete corrective archive was built with the final initial-boundary fix
  still uncommitted. Preserved it as contaminated evidence, committed the fix as `2cbebb3`, and
  reran the frozen three-sample qualification from a clean tree. All three samples remained
  unqualified, so no H5/H6 matrix was started.

### 2026-09-01 18:45 AEST - Audited G4 harness contracts

#### Task Summary

- Implemented locked policy generation, matched-quality qualification, full coverage, H5/H6
  decisions, G4 schema semantics, timing identities, and portable-evidence verification in the
  isolated `exp/g4-harness-parallel` worktree.

#### Mistakes And Fixes

- `[tool]` The WSL system Python lacked pytest/Ruff/CMake. Used ephemeral `uv run --no-project`
  tools and the isolated CPU build directory; no canonical environment was modified.
- `[tool]` PowerShell could not pass its provider-qualified UNC working path to .NET file APIs.
  Used byte-safe Python normalization and then matched each tracked file's committed line-ending
  convention before regenerating the policy hash/header.
- `[self]` The first G4 schema fixture retained legacy residuals above the tight tier. The stricter
  semantic validator exposed it; corrected the fixture instead of weakening the tier.

#### What Worked

- The generated C++ header and SHA-256 lock make JSON/C++ policy drift fatal.
- Adversarial tests cover max-iteration false positives, objective/continuous-time/path omissions,
  policy drift, ledger gaps, timing sums, decision states, and artifact tampering.
- Full CPU validation passed: Ruff, 127 pytest tests, and 41 native CTest smokes.

#### Guardrails For Next Session

- Do not classify current CUDA G4 output as qualified until it reports requested/actual runtime
  policy and consumes the generated configuration.
- Keep QOCO/hybrid conversion telemetry compatible with the primary-G4 schema's permutation,
  dual-disposition, and conversion/setup/polish timing fields.

#### Follow-Ups / Risks

- CUDA executable integration remains for the CUDA worker; this branch intentionally contains no
  CUDA numeric-update edits and made no GPU performance claim.

### 2026-09-01 19:55 AEST - G4 workstream integration

#### What Worked

- Exact QOCO and harness commits cherry-picked; the only conflict was additive scratchpad history.
- Pinned QOCO CUDA/cuDSS passed exact trajectory QP/SOCP, update, warm-primal, residual, and
  explicit dual-discard tests on RTX 5090.
- CUDA now consumes the generated policy hash and frozen numeric policy rather than shadow constants.

#### Mistakes And Fixes

- `[tool]` Initial QOCO execution omitted the package's `nvidia/cu12/lib` runtime directory.
  Added the pinned cuDSS directory and shim to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`; all 18 tests then passed.
- `[self]` A 15-outer displaced diagnostic was too expensive for interactive qualification and
  exceeded 30 minutes. Terminated it, retained the timeout, and did not count it as matrix evidence.

#### Follow-Ups / Risks

- P1-C still fails the frozen forcing test after an identical-CQP re-solve, so matched quality
  remains the authoritative blocker. Do not execute or claim the full matrix.
- The Python QOCO adapter has a valid primal-only handoff, but the nonlinear G4 family owners still
  need an end-to-end handback before H6 can be decided.

### 2026-09-01 21:50 AEST - G6 freeze tooling

#### Task Summary

- Implemented downstream evidence loading, frozen F01-F08/T01-T06 products, H1-H6 decisions,
  campaign refusal/sealing, reproducibility checks, synthetic fixtures, documentation, and CI.

#### Mistakes And Fixes

- `[self]` Used Linux-looking paths with the Windows file patch tool; it created files under
  `C:\home` instead of the WSL worktree. Detected because WSL `git status` showed only
  `pyproject.toml`; copied the implementation into the isolated WSL worktree and thereafter used
  `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-22.04` paths.
- `[tool]` WSL's system Python was 3.10 while the project requires 3.11. Used the existing `uv`
  installation to create an isolated Python 3.11 environment; did not change the system runtime.

#### What Worked

- Byte-for-byte double builds exposed rendering metadata concerns; fixed PDF/PNG metadata and
  verified all generated bundle bytes deterministically.
- Separate G6 evidence envelopes preserve G4/G5 compact-result compatibility while adding
  independent residual/replay/archive hashes and immutable URIs.

#### Guardrails For Next Session

- Use UNC paths for all dedicated file tools against WSL worktrees.
- Treat a generated freeze seal as a completeness record, never as G6 PASS or a scientific claim.
- Keep known G4 failure and unauthorised G5 state as explicit blockers until real archives arrive.

#### Follow-Ups / Risks

- Real freeze still requires complete portable G4/G5 matrices; synthetic decision outcomes have no
  scientific meaning.

### 2026-09-02 01:40 AEST - Paper 1 product-contract reconciliation

#### Task Summary

- Reconciled the narrow G6 registry against the authoritative frozen Paper 1 schema and expanded
  deterministic generation from F01-F08/T01-T06 to F01-F12/T01-T08.

#### What Worked

- Treating the figure schema as the inclusion authority while preserving the outline's placement
  distinction resolved the conflict without deleting F11 or weakening F12's diagnostic constraint.
- Requiring archived paired-repeat arrays for F10 prevented a one-summary-point bootstrap from
  manufacturing a unique regime winner.
- Adding trial-level F11 and iteration-level F12 data to hashed manifests preserved provenance
  without creating manual numeric coordinates in generator code.

#### Mistakes And Fixes

- `[self]` The first T08 implementation included only runs referenced by non-supported H1-H6
  decisions, omitting an infeasible non-hypothesis run. Added explicit retained-negative rows for
  every otherwise-unrepresented censored or failed run.
- `[self]` The first wheel still required a manual matplotlib install. Promoted matplotlib from the
  development extra to a runtime dependency and verified an isolated wheel-installed build.
- `[self]` Initial reconciliation assertions matched prose across a Markdown line wrap. Replaced
  them with semantic fragment checks.

#### Guardrails For Next Session

- Never infer an F10 unique winner from medians alone; absent paired repeat evidence means `tie`.
- F11 needs all three declared model panels and F12 needs all three risk modes before publication
  products can build.
- Keep F11 placement optionality separate from generator/evidence completeness.

#### Follow-Ups / Risks

- Real F11/F12 inputs must be emitted by G4/G5 producers in the documented hashed-manifest fields.
- Synthetic outputs remain non-scientific and the campaign freeze refusal remains mandatory.
