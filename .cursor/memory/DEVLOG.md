- Task summary:
  - Implemented the audited CPU/static Gate G4 policy, qualification, decision, coverage, schema,
    timing, and evidence-integrity contracts in an isolated worktree.
- Changes:
  - Added a SHA-256-locked JSON-to-C++ policy generator and selected-quality-tier fixed-tight rule.
  - Added matched-quality, full Cartesian ledger, paired-bootstrap H5/H6, timing identity, and
    portable-artifact validators.
  - Made primary G4 schema records require runtime/outer/hybrid/energy/failure/evidence telemetry
    while preserving legacy 1.0 record validation.
  - Replaced unconditional qualification decisions with preregistered decision functions.
- Validation:
  - Full Ruff check and whitespace check passed.
  - Full Python suite passed: 127 tests.
  - CPU native build and CTest passed: 41 tests.
  - No GPU benchmark or GPU performance workload was run.
- Follow-up notes / risks:
  - The CUDA executable must consume/report the generated runtime request before current output can
    qualify; this is intentionally left as a clean integration point for the CUDA worker.
  - QOCO/hybrid integration must populate permutation, dual disposition, and complete timing fields.
